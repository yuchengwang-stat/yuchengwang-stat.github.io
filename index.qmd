## Bio

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at the **University of Pittsburgh**, honored to be an **Andrew W. Mellon Predoctoral Fellow** (2025-2026).

My research focuses on developing **statistically rigorous and computationally efficient frameworks** for high-dimensional genomic data. I am particularly interested in Bayesian methodology and its application to **cell-free DNA (cfDNA)** for non-invasive disease diagnostics.

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained my M.S. in Statistical Practice from **Carnegie Mellon University** and my B.S. in Statistics from **SUSTech**.

## Research Interests

My research interests include **Bayesian Statistics**, **Machine Learning**, and **Statistical Genomics**. 

I have specialized expertise in **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, **Parallel Computing**, and **Rcpp implementation**, aiming to develop scalable tools for large-scale biomedical data

## Selected Experience

* **Bioinformatics Software Engineer Intern | SignatureDx** (2025)
    * Developed ML-driven cfDNA deconvolution frameworks for monitoring organ-transplant rejection.
* **Algorithm Engineer Intern | JD.com** (2020)
    * Built large-scale recommendation pipelines using PySpark and LightGBM for millions of users.
